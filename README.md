cloud-granny
========

This sample is a fork of the original [Granny's Addressbook] (https://github.com/osintegrators/JavaSpringGranny) provided by Open Software Integrators originally, which
has been optimized for [SAP HANA Cloud Platform](http://hcp.sap.com/) (HCP).

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate how easy it is to deploy typical Java web application (such as this one) to HCP and get it running. 

For detailed instruction how-to get the project up & running please refer to the following [tutorial](#) (TBD). 


> **Note:** There is a related project called [Enterprise Granny](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-enterprise-granny), which shares the same origin/roots. The main
> intention of **Enterprise Granny** is to take the original **Granny's Addressbook** application and teach best practices by making the application
> enterprise-ready step by step. 


Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/saphcp/cloud-granny`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/saphcp/cloud-granny/archive/master.zip).


Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, the SAP HANA Cloud Platform -Samples project will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
